The .env file has been deleted locally by github because of .gitignore
It is still there and i could see it, but the python app.py   does not see it so the website will give me internal server error.
To go around this, make sure env-api is activated but not running, type in command prompt
set DATABASE_URL....
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID....
set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET....    
just copy and paste after set and it should work, this is a temporary solution as long as the console stays open, otherwise when it gets close i will have to do this again whenever i want to use it
